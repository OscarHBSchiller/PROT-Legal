# Limitations

*Understanding what PROT can and can't do helps you use it more effectively.*

---

> ⚠️ **PROT is a risk analysis tool, not a legal advisor.** Results highlight clauses that may be potentially unfair or risky based on known patterns — they are not a definitive legal opinion. Always consult a qualified legal professional for advice about your specific situation.

---

## Known Limitations

### 🔤 Regex-Based Detection

PROT uses pattern-matching (regex) to identify suspicious clauses. It cannot truly **understand context** the way a lawyer would — a clause that looks risky by pattern may be perfectly standard in context, and vice versa.

---

### 🎭 False Positives & Negatives

Some flagged clauses may be **industry-standard and legally fine**. Equally, a genuinely problematic clause written in unusual phrasing may slip past detection entirely. Results should be treated as a starting point, not a verdict.

---

### 🌐 Language & Formatting

PROT is optimised for **English-language documents** with standard HTML formatting. Non-English Terms of Service, image-based text, or heavily obfuscated documents may not be analysed correctly or at all.

---

### ⚖️ Jurisdiction Coverage

Consumer law varies enormously by region. While PROT covers major jurisdictions (US, EU, UK, AU), **local or niche regulations** may not be included. A clause legal in one region may be unfair in another — PROT may not always account for this distinction.

---

### 🕐 Law Doesn't Stand Still

Consumer protection law evolves constantly. PROT's detection patterns are updated regularly, but there may be a **lag between new legislation and updated coverage**. Newly enacted protections may not yet be reflected in our analysis.

---

### 📄 Scope: ToS & EULAs Only

PROT is designed specifically for Terms of Service and End User License Agreements. It is **not built to analyse** employment contracts, NDAs, financial agreements, tenancy documents, or other contract types where different legal frameworks apply.

---

### 🔍 Dynamic & Gated Content

Some services load ToS content dynamically via JavaScript or behind login walls. PROT analyses **what is visible in the page at scan time** — portions of a document that haven't rendered or require authentication may be missed.

---

### 🚫 Not Legal Enforcement

Flagging a clause as risky does not mean the clause is **automatically unenforceable**. Enforceability is determined by courts on a case-by-case basis. PROT surfaces risk for awareness — it cannot predict or guarantee legal outcomes.

---

## 💡 How to Get the Most from PROT

- Treat flagged clauses as **conversation starters**, not final rulings. Use them as prompts to read more carefully.
- If a clause is flagged on a high-stakes agreement (financial services, healthcare, employment-adjacent), seek professional legal advice.
- Check back on previously scanned sites — ToS documents change frequently, often without notice.
- Combine PROT's output with your own reading of the document; context a regex can't see may matter.
- Use the [Resources](RESOURCES.md) page to learn about the consumer protection laws relevant to your region.
