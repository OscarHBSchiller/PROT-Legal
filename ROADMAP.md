# Roadmap

> **Every Quarter** — Ongoing quality-of-life improvements, expanded contract support, and UI enhancements throughout all stages.

---

## 🚀 Q2 2026 — Launch

**PROT Goes Live**

Official public launch of PROT. Regex-powered Terms of Service analysis, risk highlighting, multi-region consumer law coverage (ACL, CRA, 93/13/EEC), and the free + premium tier structure.

---

## 🤖 Q3 2026 — AI Insights & Contract Monitoring *(Upcoming)*

**AI-Powered Analysis**

Pro users gain AI-powered clause explanations and smart contract monitoring. PROT checks for silent ToS updates on sites you've previously scanned and alerts you when something changes.

---

## 👨‍👩‍👧 Q4 2026 – Q1 2027 — Personal & Family Plans *(Upcoming)*

**Multi-Device Support**

Multi-device support with Personal and Family subscription tiers. Paired with the launch of the official PROT website for news, patch notes, and community announcements.

---

## 📱 Q2–Q3 2027 — Mobile App & Desktop Client *(Planned)*

**Beyond the Browser**

PROT expands beyond Chrome. A dedicated mobile app and desktop client will enable batch analysis and PDF document scanning — review contracts even before you open a browser.

---

## 🔭 Onwards & Beyond

Continued refinement of detection capabilities and the development of **Report to PROT** — a feature enabling users to submit batch reports directly to consumer protection enforcement agencies and NGOs.

As PROT matures, **feature roll-down** means free users can expect to gain access to current premium features over time. Our commitment to accessible consumer protection doesn't stop at launch.
