# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 2025**

PROT ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension handles information when you use it.

---

## Introduction

PROT is designed with privacy as a core principle. **We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or personal information about you.**

All contract analysis happens entirely within your browser. No data about these analyses is ever sent to our servers or any third parties.

---

## Data We Collect

### What PROT Does NOT Collect

- Personal identification information (name, email, address, phone number, etc.)
- Browser history or websites you visit
- Terms of Service documents or their content
- Analysis results or flagged terms
- IP addresses or location data
- Device identifiers
- Cookies or tracking identifiers

---

## Local Processing

When you use PROT, the extension:

1. Analyzes Terms of Service and EULAs within your browser
2. Compares terms against consumer protection law patterns
3. Displays results directly to you in a report
4. Stores no data on external servers

---

## Chrome Extension Permissions

PROT requests certain permissions to function. These permissions are used solely for:

- **Content Script Access:** To analyze webpage content for Terms of Service text
- **Storage:** To save only your local settings and preferences (e.g., performance mode toggle)
- **Active Tab:** To read the current page for analysis when you open the extension

---

## Premium Features and Accounts

If you choose to upgrade to PROT Premium, you may be asked to create an account. In this case:

- Account creation only collects data necessary for account management and billing
- We collect your email address and subscription status
- Payment information is processed through Paddle, a certified third-party payment processor — PROT never stores your payment details
- Your analysis history and reports remain on your device
- We do not track which websites you visit or what terms you analyze

---

## Third-Party Services

PROT uses the following third-party services:

- **Supabase** — for account authentication and subscription status storage
- **Paddle** — for payment processing (premium subscriptions only)

We do not share your data with any other third parties. Supabase and Paddle have their own privacy policies which govern their handling of data.

---

## Security

Since PROT processes contract analysis locally on your device, your data benefits from your device's own security. For premium accounts:

- Passwords are hashed and never stored in plain text
- Session tokens are stored locally in your browser's extension storage
- All communication with our backend uses HTTPS

We recommend:

- Keeping your browser and operating system updated
- Using a strong, unique password for your PROT account
- Installing PROT only from the official Chrome Web Store

---

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Access this Privacy Policy at any time
- Disable the extension and remove it from your browser
- Delete your account and any associated data by contacting us
- Contact us with any privacy concerns

---

## Children's Privacy

PROT is not directed to individuals under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If we become aware of such collection, we will delete it promptly.

---

## Policy Changes

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected with a new "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Your continued use of PROT constitutes acceptance of any changes.
