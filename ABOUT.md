# About PROT

*Protecting consumers through intelligent Terms of Service analysis*

---

## Our Mission

PROT empowers consumers to understand their rights by automatically analyzing complex Terms of Service and End User License Agreements for potentially unfair or risky terms based on consumer protection laws.

We believe no one should have to be a lawyer to know when a contract is taking advantage of them.

## How It Works

**🔍 Automatic Analysis**
PROT scans Terms of Service and EULAs as you browse, identifying clauses that may violate consumer protection laws — without you having to do anything.

**⚖️ Law-Based Detection**
Our analysis is grounded in real consumer protection legislation including the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), UK Consumer Rights Act (CRA), EU Directive 93/13/EEC, and GDPR.

**📊 Detailed Reports**
Get clear, readable reports highlighting risky terms with plain-English explanations of why they may be problematic and what consumer protection frameworks they may breach.

**🌍 Multi-Region Support**
Coverage for major jurisdictions including Australia, the EU, the UK, and the US, with detection patterns tailored to region-specific consumer protections.

**🔒 Privacy First**
Your data stays with you. All analysis happens locally in your browser — PROT never collects or transmits the content of documents you analyze.

**⭐ Premium Features**
Unlock advanced analysis, contract reporting tools, and AI-powered clause explanations with PROT Premium.
