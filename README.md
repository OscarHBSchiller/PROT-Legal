# PROT — Consumer Protection Analyzer

**Clarity. Freedom. Compliance.**

PROT is a free Chrome extension that automatically scans Terms of Service and End User License Agreements for potentially unfair or risky clauses — based on real consumer protection law.

## What It Does

Most people click "I Agree" without reading. PROT reads for you.

The extension runs silently in the background as you browse. When it detects a Terms of Service or EULA, it analyses the text against known patterns from consumer protection legislation across Australia, the EU, the UK, and the US — and surfaces anything worth your attention.

Risk is graded across four levels:

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ☢️ Nuclear | Combination clauses that may present a severe risk for users |
| 🚨 High | Clauses that significantly favour the company over you |
| ⚠️ Medium | Clauses worth reading carefully |
| ℹ️ Low | Standard terms that still carry some risk |

## Key Features

- **Click-to-scroll** — click any finding in the popup to jump directly to that clause on the page
